                                Around AD 600, Pope Boniface IV dedicated the month of May to remembering the heroes of
                                the Catholic Church and called it "All Saints Day".

                                On November 1st, "Samhain," a famous Celtic festival in Europe, was celebrated. It was
                                believed that the end of harvest and entering into winter was the gateway for dead
                                souls and spirits to enter the living realm. People celebrated this day by calling out
                                to dead spirits, appeasing evil spirits, and sacrificing animals and humans.

                                The Catholic Church, wanting uniformity within the different religious beliefs in
                                Europe, combined the two days to October 31st, calling it "All Hollow's Eve".

                                When this celebration entered the United States in the 1800's, it started off as a
                                seemingly innocent passing out of candy and chocolates to neighbors. But from the
                                1900's onward, Halloween has been increasing in its involvement with Satanic practices
                                and worship.
